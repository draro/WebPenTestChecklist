# WEB APP PENTESTING CHECKLIST

## Information gathering

1. Search engine recon
2. Webserver fingerprint
3. Source code investigations
4. Asset discovery
5. User emulation ( Keep MiTM proxy open for site map population )
6. Endpoint discovery
7. Enumerate any admin interfaces
8. Enumeration of errors and stack traces
9. Fingerprint the application
10. Map the application architecture
11. Map out integration points
12. Find:

    - Data flows
    - Paths
    - Race’s

## Exploits

### Login system

- [Test the JWT token](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/10-Testing_JSON_Web_Tokens)
- Signature Verification
- The none signing algorithm sometimes is accepted
- Weak HMAC Keys
- HMAC vs Public Key Confusion

### Login bypass

- Directory brute force
- SQLi
  Session ID prediction
  Username enumeration
  Credentials transported over HTTP
  Default credentials
  Issues in the registration process
  Tokens sent over plaintext?
  DoS by entering too many characters
  Register a user with XSS attack vector in every input field, use for further testing
  Weak password systems
  Test password reset systems
  Add second email parameter with email of attacker
  Any tokens sent over HTTP
  Weak predictable tokens
  Is the user forced to reauthenticate
  SessionID in URL
  Logout should invalidate session tokens
  Validate that a hard session timeout exists.
  Weak lockout
  Is there any alternative login system
  Oauth
  Mobile login
  Token login with weak tokens
  Testing for session puzzling
  https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/08-Testing_for_Session_Puzzling
  Session hijacking
  Request from attackers website to victims bank for example to login. The bank will possibly return session vars if bad config. This leads to attackers owning session vars now.
  https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/09-Testing_for_Session_Hijacking
  Input validation
  XSS
  Reflected XSS
  Stored XSS
  Blind XSS
  DOM XSS
  SQLi
  XXE
  Command injection
  SSTI/CSTI
  Insert ${7\*7} into every field you see, if it resolves, investigate further
  SSRF
  Add burp collaborator URL in everywhere that URL resolves
  HTTP parameter polution
  https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/04-Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_Pollution
  LDAP injection
  SSI (server side includes injection)
  XPath injection
  Clickjacking
  GraphQL testing
  General exploits
  RFI/LFI
  Insecure session management
  Subdomain takeover
  Check if user role is user controllable (Can you make yourself admin)
  Test the cookies attributes
  Sensitive cookies should have secure and httponly flag
  Domain and path need to be set right
  Expires in timely manner
  SameSite Attribute
  CSRF testing
  Only on sensitive functions, not on login/logout
  File upload testing
  Uploading of malicious content
  File upload restrictions
  Changing mimetype
  Using nullbytes
  Test integration points for overextended priviledges
  Test if the browser caches sensitive information
  Use the back button after logout timer
  Click around after login timer
  Check cache headers on sensitive pages
  There should not be any weak encryption used anywhere
  Search for the following keywords to identify use of weak algorithms: MD4, MD5, RC4, RC2, DES, Blowfish, SHA-1, ECB
  Business logic flaws
  Data validation
  example may be if I use my credit card at multiple locations very quickly it may be possible to exceed my limit if the systems are basing decisions on last night’s data.
  Identify data injection points.
  Validate that all checks are occurring on the back end and can’t be bypassed.
  Attempt to break the format of the expected data and analyze how the application is handling it.
  Test for hidden parameters that you can change with impact.
  For example changing account type from consumer to business
  Check for things that are only hidden in the front-end
  Check for disabled fields that are only front-end disabled
  Integrity checks
  Review the project documentation for components of the system that move, store, or handle data.
  Determine what type of data is logically acceptable by the component and what types the system should guard against.
  Determine who should be allowed to modify or read that data in each component.
  Attempt to insert, update, or delete data values used by each component that should not be allowed per the business logic workflow.
  Test functions that can only be used a limited amount of times
  For example a coupon code that you should only be applying one time but that’s just a front-end check
  If something gets added to account and should be withdrawn again, check if it is.
  For example if you order an item but cancel the order, your loyatee points should go down as well.
